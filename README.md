# Decision_Tree_From_Scratch

The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data
generators that are used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine
learning algorithms.
Datasets are available on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html.
For this assignment, you need to download the datasets “Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame” and “Wine” from
the above link which are a categorical and a continuous dataset, respectively.

a) Design an ID3 decision tree classifier (Based on Information Gain) to classify each dataset
mentioned above. Report the accuracy based on the 10-times-10-fold cross validation
approach. You should report mean and variance of the accuracy for each dataset. Draw the
confusion matrix for each dataset and analyze your observation.
b) Try the same experiment by using the Gain-Ratio instead of Information Gain in
constructing the decision tree.
